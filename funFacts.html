			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				I hope you found some of the facts about me intriguing. The facts are all extremely random
				because I was running out of content about myself; I don't have many accomplishments or 
				unique traits under my belt. To me at least, some of these points are pretty funny, especially
				without any context.
