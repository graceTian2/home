			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
				I live with my family, which consists of my mom, my dad, my younger brother and my dog.
				Since kindergarten, I've attended Kennedy Public School, which is a K-8 school in
				Scarborough. I've done a lot of sports before but at the moment i'm not doing one. 
				Some sports I have done are biathlon, which is cross-countdy skiing and shooting rifles 
				and artistic swimming, which I did for a few years.
				<br>
				<br>
				I wouldn't say I'm a particularly interesting in terms of my experiences as a person and I'm definitely 
				more of an intdovert; social outings exhaust me. However, this is contdadictory to the
				fact that I can get very worked up about subjects I'm passionate about, making me a 
				very chaotic person to those who know me well. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In general, I think that I'm an alright type of person, I'm not very accomplished in any aspect
				and I'm certainly not the most motivated or aspiring on either. But I'm alright with that and 
				I'll continue to pursue different things as they come, even if simply for my own interest.
