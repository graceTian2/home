				<h3>Artistic Swimming</h3>
				<p>
					Artistic swimming is a unique sport that is essentially a combination of dance and swimming. 
					I first was introduced to artistic swimming through a friend at around 11 or 12. I 
					then joined Chaco Artistic Swimming Club for 2 years, competing on a provincial
					level. We trained around 16 hours a week. In summer 2019, I had the great opportunity to attend a training camp in 
					Chengdu, China. After that year, I took a break for a year before 
					joining another team, Markham Artistic Swimming Club. As of this year, I haven't been
					doing artistic swimming and I don't intend to get back into it in the forseeable 
					future.

				<h3>Biathlon</h3>
				<p>
					In grade 7, the year I ended up not doing artistic swimming, I joined the Royal Canadian Air Cadets and their
					biathlon team. Biathlon, for those who don't know, is a winter sport that involves cross-country skiing and 
					shooting rifles. Though I only stayed in the Air Cadets for a year, it was definitely a cool experience. The 
					biatholon team met up every week to train and in the winter, we drove up north to practice skiing. We also got
					to train with air rifles at a facility, though at competitions we used real rifles.
					<br>
					<br>
					We got to compete a few times throughout the year, with one of the most notable times being when we travelled
					8 hours by bus to Sault St. Marie. It was a fun experience and I got to meet a lot of new people. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I think part of the reason I enjoyed this sport was because I enjoy the cold a lot; I don't tend to get cold
					easily and like artistic swimming, it's an endurance sport. At the most extreme, we had to ski in negative 20-30
					degree celcius weather, through strong winds and snow. This also made the shooting part harder, as it was more
					difficult to see the targets. However, all that struggle made seeing the finish line every time just that much 
					more rewarding and I definitely don't regret the time I spent involved in this sport.

				<h3>Other Sports</h3>
				<p>
					Other than artistic swimming and biathlon, I have done a few other sports, both in school and outside of school.
					Between grades 1 and 8, I joined a few sports teams, including bordenball, track and field and cross-country. The vast majority of 
					times, I joined only because of pressure from others because I don't like running. Before that, I also participated
					in gymnastics, skating and dance, though I didn't particularly enjoy any of them.
					<br>
					<br>
					I've always generally been an active person, but the problem I face a lot is staying motivated, especially over long periods
					of time if I don't enjoy an activity. I will get frustrated with my performance and work extremely hard, trying to 
					maintain or find motivation until I am burnt out and completely lose any will to continue. Though I know this isn't a great thing,
					it has happened a few times before. It also means that I rise up in the ranks quickly when doing a sport, pushed mostly by my own
					spite, before simply not being able to go on and dropping out altogether.
					<br>
					<br>
					This stays in line with the fact that I never seem to be able to continually enjoy and stay motivated on an activity if I am 
					not genuinely into it. It is nearly impossible for me to keep at an activity in the long run when outside factors like praise 
					or rewards are involved.
